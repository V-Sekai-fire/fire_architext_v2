# Dataset Card for Architext

## Dataset Description
This is the raw training data used to train the Architext models referenced in "Architext: Language-Driven Generative Architecture Design" . 

- **Homepage:** https://architext.design/
- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07519
- **Point of Contact:** Theodoros Galanos (https://twitter.com/TheodoreGalanos)


## Dataset Creation
The data were synthetically generated by a parametric design script in Grasshopper 3D, a virtual algorithmic environment in the design software Rhinoceros 3D.

## Considerations for Using the Data
The data describe once instance of architectural design, specifically layout generation for residential appartments. Even in that case, the data is limited in the possible shapes they can represent, size, and typologies. Additionally, the annotations used as language prompts to generate a design are restricted to automatically generated annotations based on layout characteristics (adjacency, typology, number of spaces).

### Licensing Information
The dataset is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
